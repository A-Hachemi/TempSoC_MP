# TempSoC_MP
Temperature system-on-chip PhD mini-project for CDTA.

We are a team of 11 PhD students in a joint doctoral program between CDTA and the university of Blida 1. Our team is split into 2, 7 digital and 4 analog developers.

The main goal of this project is to create a system on chip for the readout of a commercial temperature sensor. Our choice of sensor was the LM35 temperature sensor, as it provides a linear voltage output, which allows us to skip linearization.

You can find the main architecture of the SoC "TopArchitecture.png" in the repository.
